# AR-App-using-Vuforia

Used Vuforia and Unity3D to make a marker based AR app for Android or IOS.
First added a 3D model of Donald Trump and then some c# scripts for moving him around. This method will also work with any other free 3D model that you can find. 

Just download howdy.apk and shoot your camera to a 200 rupee note , you can see an asset of Trump with controls so that you can move him around.
